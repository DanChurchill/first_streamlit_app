As part of the Snowflake Data Applications course I created a Google form that uploaded results to my Snowflake Database, then built a Streamlit application using Python to read from an API as well as read/write to my Snowflake database tables.  The application can be seen at https://danchurchill-first-streamlit-app-streamlit-app-hpnx0m.streamlitapp.com/
